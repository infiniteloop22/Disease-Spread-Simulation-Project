# Disease Spread Simulation Project 3

# Overview
This project simulates the spread of a disease through a populated area to help in planning mitigation strategies. It shows how a disease spreads from community to community based on various configurable parameters. The simulation runs over a configurable period, where each iteration represents one hour, and logs important data like infection rates, deaths, quarantines, and more.

# Features
Simulate the spread of a disease over time.
Track population dynamics, including infection, death, and quarantine status.
Generate reports on infection rates, deaths, and quarantines.
Configurable parameters like travel patterns, infection spread rate, quarantine chances, and more.
Analyze and modify the simulation to test different scenarios.
Outputs detailed logs and statistics after each hour of simulation.
